<p>I am all huddled up in bed and yes, you'll notice the time stamp. I'm banking on tons of sleep and an early morning. Time to get switched over to a more energetic me and stock up on the missing sleep from last weekend.</p>
<p>I'm truck shopping. So far this has entailed looping in my brother and my father in endless nervous phone calls and simultaneous smart phone tow weight capacity calculations. This purchase, unlike my rather affordable tiny house/trailer/camper, feels much bigger. It has all of the responsibility of keeping the house safe and always with me while I take 8 feet by 31 feet and tens of thousands of lbs on the freeway at 65.</p>
<p>I keep trying to talk myself into a kind of trucker like bravado, but the plain truth of it is that I'm a little freaked out. I'm hoping to get the one Randy test drove with me today. It costs almost four times as much as the trailer and I'm hoping it will be worth every gasoline-sucking penny. A whole lotta practice and just plain driving it should really make a big difference. Maybe I'll get those cowboy boots after all.</p>
