<p>I miss being an international traveler on a shoe-string budget deep in the thick of it, every moment heavy with novelty. This identity shift rubs at me, like a stiff clothing tag, an itch scratched by looking up AirBNB rooms and flights to exotic locales. There's also that unfulfilled adventure of my snail home stuck in the mud.</p>
<p>This week+ has been characterized by clarity of boundaries. Of my personal rules, mostly agreed upon by others, being asked and reciprocated. I speak very obtusely about romantic relationships and business relationships. How a clear definition allows for freer movement, simpler decision-making, on everyone's part. For the most part.</p>
<p>What I do know is that I'm decidedly and happily single and busy as **** with my business. With my job, it always feels like I'm dangling off of some unknown edge, desperately trying to learn everything I need to to get it done. This is very similar to my plumbing and other issues with the trailer.</p>
<p>Coming back to Portland has been thus far characterized as overwhelming, underwhelming, and just plain busy. There's no end to that in sight. Glad it's bedtime.</p>
