<p>I had no idea how much the idea of being stuck in the mud was weighing on me until I got the trailer out of the mud. Granted it's on the heels of spending Valentine's day with a deliberative me-time emotive cleanse, but the sheer relief of prying that trailer out today is a good clue.</p>
<p>What an afternoon! I left work early, moved two meetings to other times, and started at Harbor Freight for a 12 ton bottle jack. An hour and a half later I was crouched under the trailer with that jack, some stumps, boards and bricks, ready to sprint free at any second should something slip and all 8600+ lbs swung my way.</p>
<p>The final freeing from the leveled out stump/board job that kept me from sliding out of bed accidentally every night was a remote controlled crawler shoving the trailer off of the bottle jack and steadfastly to it's position in the sun. A key element to the big push today.</p>
<p>Maybe it's global warming  and s***'s just going to get way more crazy in the very near future, but it's been balmy here for over a week - sunny, clear, warm. I got a summer's reprieve in February. Doesn't bode well for weather reliability, seasons, rain, and the like. Sure worked out well for my limited needs today.</p>
<p>I'm getting more and more comfortable driving Biggie these days. The more I do it, the easier it gets. At least most of the time. Parking lots, streets that are a narrow one-lane with cars parked on both sides, and the occasional semi sandwich will challenge my deodorant on a good day.  Bizarrely enough, parallel parking downtown is considerably easier with the tow-friendly side mirrors and rear view camera with sensor system. Wish I had one on the front too, but....</p>
<p>My dream is getting closer and it touches on my adventurer spirit in a big way. I have grand romantic dreams whose reality includes getting real close and personal with sewage, the 23 year old pressure RV plumbing connections, and driving around a serious land yacht of 240 square feet of living space with washer and dryer. It's like training for a marathon but a whole lot easier and sometimes in a bathrobe with a cigarette dangling out of my mouth and looking as trailer as possible. With some minor makeup from the night before and well-placed jewelry, it can look pretty glamorous/hot mess.</p>
<p>It's my life and now I can do a lot more with some parts of it.</p>
