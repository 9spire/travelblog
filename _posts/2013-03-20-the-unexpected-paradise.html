<p>So Bali is not at all what I thought it was going to be. It really superseded any of my expectations and is conversely a bit of a let down. Okay, maybe I should be a bit more informative - the area of Bali I'm currently in is thick with foreigners, businesses for foreigners, and generally geared to skew the Balinese people and culture while trying service hordes of people from all over the world. I've sat on the beach twice and just watched airplane after airplane land, a continuous stream into the single airport here. It's also Bali, hot (really, really hot), tropical plants, tropical birds calling, gorgeous waves on a trash-littered beach, the best manicure I've had performed by native people on their knees in the cooking sand. I don't know how to embrace this totally - the blend of new and old, of anger and opportunity, of beauty and the dark underbelly. Intestinal parasites: likely. Incredible surf: always. Great vegetarian food. Poisoning by mixed drinks mixed with bad stuff. Genuinely nice Balinese people. Folks angry at how their country leaves them as security guards, maids, and giving incredible manicures to foreigners on the beach.</p>

<p>Now I've been sidetracked a bit by the dichotomy of this place. MY reality has included my very first surfing lesson today. Am I a surfer? Hell no. Did I ride that first wave all of the way in while standing up? Hell yes! Sunburned to the point where I'm not blistered but close, and ecstatic from the experience.</p>

<p>I want to head into the heart of this place. See the volcanos, the small villages, get away from the rampant tourism and into less comfortable areas as soon as I can surf a little better. More tomorrow...</p>
