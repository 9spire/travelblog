<p>Day spent behind a computer (yes, like now). I'm on 11 hours straight and wiped out. A low-grade fever comes and goes, never as full-on as at 4:30am, when I woke up chilled and unable to get warm. Not a good sign. Nothing 12 cups of coffee can't fix and a whole lotta computer work. I don't know how much longer I can go without crashing though, and the letters are hard to make out on this blog entry.</p>
<p>Made a random discovery the other day that I wanted to mention, though. A shop near my place offers everything, check out this list of services: ear piercing, dental work (crowns, cavities, whitenings), botox, fillers, boob jobs, rhinoplasty, the works. Oh yeah. Can't wait to drop some coin in that place and wake up with.... You fill in the blanks. :)</p>
<p>Again, lazy, no pics, don't think I've even left the computer, much less the apartment. The view from the balcony and roof help me feel as though I'm not just wasting away, but it's also a glittering skyline of what I'm not doing too. Have to have these days and there are more like this coming. Hopefully I'll be well, have a gallon of coffee, and the code will flow as does some hard hitting music.</p>
<p>About to call off sick and try to get some sleep. I'm running on less than 4 hours total and can't seem to keep going any longer than I have. Til tomorrow!</p>
<p>P.S. The guys had a wild evening that ended up with Aaron face-down on the couch when I got up this morning, looking for a blanket, and no Shaughnessy. Shaughnessy just rolled in two hours ago - apparently a Thai bartender took pity on him when she found him drunk, penniless and wandered off alone. This woman took him home over an hour outside of downtown, put him to bed, fed him and took care of him until she dropped him off on her way back to work this evening. Thailand, the land of smiles.</p>
