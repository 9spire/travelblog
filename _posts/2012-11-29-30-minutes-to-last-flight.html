<p>The Taipei airport is a strange blend of elements. The super-wired lounge I'm sitting in with wall screens kids can play on, a huge library, and wired chairs happens to smell like cat pee, for example. There are tons of hi-end stores like Burberry, Rolex, and Tiffany, and a toilet stall in the women's bathroom that is basically a urinal in the floor. Can't wait to get out of here and onto my final destination. I'm exhausted by this long layover, where I found a quiet corner off in the many halls of the airport and slept with my bags, using the airport blankets and pillows for almost four hours.</p>

<p>I've gotten a lot of work done, but at this last hour, I'm unable to get it online as internet is spotty and I keep getting dropped half way through migrating the many files needed to set this thing up live.</p>
<p>Time for an actual stretch of sleep, a shower/bath, and maybe a meal that isn't questionable ingredients floating in a greasy broth or a remarkably American Burger King dinner.</p>
<p>First, another public bathroom sink shower is in order... perhaps a comb through the hair and a dash of makeup so I don't scare all Thai citizenry that encounters me on landing.</p>
