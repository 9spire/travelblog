<p>Comes the Ted Talk on Shame. brene getting out on the stage and talking about being the man in the arena, who at best wins and at worst loses, but he is out there daringly. She says that shame is the gremlin that tells you about all of your losses as you are on the precipice of some large shift in life. Some monumental or small daring undertaking.</p>
<p>I'm watching this talk and on the screen on the chair back in front of me the maps displays an overview, SFO just indicated on the monitor, Hawaii thousands of mile behind too, the airplane icon is floating over Tokoyo, and I think I'll name my gremlin Carl.</p>
