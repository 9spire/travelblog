<p>Okay, "prayer" number 3 is straight up ominous. And the day seemed to follow suit. How can a day here be bad? Well, it's all in my head, of course, it's the only place a bad day can occur and occur it did.</p>
<p>Check it:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Difficulties encountered in conducting activities. Some are ill-intentioned. Suffering from worry and restlessness. Hard to find the ones you want to see. Good fortune no in sight. Mismatching is likely. Calm down, better not rush."</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah. That's it. Day 3. Found in a numbered box in a temple next to the incense and candles. Maybe I should have bought more incense and candles and burned this day's fortune in the ensuing inferno.</p>
<p>No pictures today. Just a day with my computer, worry, and restlessness. I'm spending way too much time worrying about the future. What next? And after looking at beach pictures for the last 90 minutes for a PETA project, I'm wondering why I'm in a city where I don't leave the guesthouse, instead of on the beach where I don't leave the guesthouse and have a better view?</p>
<p>A nice, long conversation with my brother (at least 30 minutes of conversation with a person in a day of 0 minutes...) yielded my resolve to work my ass off until Monday, try to get on top of work, leave my worry and restlessness to wait until I take care of business. Despite all of the very logical reasons for me to be behind (stolen equipment followed by borrowing equipment, and all that other stuff....), I don't have to be behind any more and that is my singular purpose. Spend as little baht as possible, knuckle down, buckle down and work.</p>
<p>This does not make for interesting blog entries. Sorry folks.</p>
<p>I'm also reticent to put in my more personal thoughts and observations, being in the more negative side of things. To put it succinctly, read the fortune above.</p>
<p>Calm down, better not rush.</p>
