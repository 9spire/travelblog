<p>What does it say about my moral character that when I learned my auto insurance went up 80% the only thing that puts a smile on my face is knowing I accidentally rear-ended a car full of mormon missionaries?</p>
<p>Truck purchased. Picking it up tomorrow. It's so big.</p>
<p>Had a great night out on the roller rink, adult skate night top 40 DJ style. There was hip skate hop line dancing, a slow skate, and a surprising density of roller blades. I got my skate-y groove on for two hours until the blisters threatened to form fully. You know that hot spot where there's only so many more joy laps you can make before you end up limping around for a week.</p>
<p>Ah the wind in my 2.5 inches of hair, the smell of shoe sanitizing spray, and the latest slow jams one after another... In my current state of single-hood, there was a definite wistfulness for that disco ball lit couple skate where one of you awkwardly goes backwards while you hold slightly tugging hands since you don't want to or can't sync up exactly (this isn't the fox trot folks). There's Dr. Pepper lip gloss. Ah sigh.</p>
<p>Peace and quiet, tea and a mountain of New Years Resolution fruits and vegetables were here when I got home and turned the heat up from 55. Having to lug a 30+ tank of propane in and out of a tiny hatch and a bizarre variety of rental cars is motivation enough to Jimmy Carter it around here. I haven't timed it yet, but I'm betting the Coors can will turn bright blue after and hour in here with the heat off. There's pretty much no insulation and plus anyone who bought this thing in 1992 probably appreciated the nickname of "Snowbird". There's a certain amount of accumulated wisdom behind fleeing the cold with your house behind your truck.</p>
<p>Picking up the truck tomorrow. Got to learn how to drive this thing. Thinking it might grow on me faster than I imagine. Cowboy Cadillac. Hm. Night y'all.</p>
