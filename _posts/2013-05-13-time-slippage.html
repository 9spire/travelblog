<p>Bought a ticket home. Well, whatever Portland is now to me. Home-ish? And the prevaling emotion/feeling is fear, worry, stress. Time to investigate that.</p>
<p>It's just been too amazing to write. No time, too busy doing amazing. Too busy with happy to share. Sri Lanka has been a blur of archeological wonders of the Hydraulic period on cliffs, under the shadows of Dagoba's built with enough bricks to make a 3 meter high wall from London to Edinborough. Then there is the steaming safari in the back of a jeep-like 4 wheel drive bouncing around deeply grooved back roads as we flee a charging elephant. And the last few days in the misty mountains and rolling tea plantations of Kandy, looking out from the hotel balcony to the lake far below, keeping an eye on the roving bands of monkey's numbering in the 30s as they sweep through the neighborhood for food. The many meals of cakes and curries, chutneys, and spice, the bus rides with at least 20 people over the bus capacity, most of them standing on, over, or under me, creating a net of arms crisscrossing the seated passengers as we try to stay upright as the driver screams around corners on tiny roads, his CD player blaring the top 21 Indian hits.</p>

<p>Pictures, yes. Coming. And the stories to go with them. But for now, I'm already one half gone from Sri Lanka, with the next few hours here to be sucked up greedily, and then off to the next, the next, and the next, before finally flying back to Portland.</p>
