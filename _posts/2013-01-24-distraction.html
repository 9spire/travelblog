<p>Okay, so he came back the next day. Yeah, that one. And me, being flattered/curious, put all 6 feet and 4 inches onto the back of my motorbike, and headed off toward Mae Rim, just north of Chiang Mai. We ducked and wove through traffic and honestly, it was the safer choice to ask him to put his hands around my waist to help me balance. Scouts honor.</p>
<p>We stopped off at a huge monkey sign, saw some sad monkeys in cages and left before the "show" as it was far too disturbing and he really didn't want to support this freak show as much as I didn't. Back on the bike, up into the hills, we rode and burned 2xs more fuel than me alone, pulling over into a park to see waterfalls. And what waterfalls! It was a long hike up, 10 levels total of these complex falls. The trail was nicely maintained, the afternoon sun no longer reaching the water and we made it to level 8 before we got into the water.</p>
<p>Cool, a delightful rush, we waded in hand-in-hand and got under the stream. I had to grab my camera and snap some shots and then he wanted a turn, telling me in halting English to pose this way and that, telling me I looked like model. Let me tell you, flattery goes a fair bit.</p>
<p>We were in the water until the park ranger showed up and told us the park was closing in the nicest way possible. Drying off on a sarong I brought, we pulled on dry clothes over wet swimsuits and hiked out. The drive back was warm and just before sunset, his hands around my waist as I leaned into the corners and dodged trucks, tuk-tuks, and rick-shaws.</p>

<p>Back in Chaing Mai, we shared a meal of pasta and vegetables, his diet was a confusing bit of rules involving the timing of different ingredients and forbidden ones. He appreciated how I talked slowly, as he was working on his English, and I appreciated the view. A drink later and it was time for me to work.</p>
<p>I woke to a knock on my door and I had to disappoint this time. I spent the day working and in the evening, there was another knock to let me know he was ready for dinner. Which was lovely and followed by some time hanging out before I had to work again. I find this whole experience strange, first to be actively courted by a 23 year-old who barely speaks my language, looks like a model himself (hello teeth!), and has asked me about marriage already. Strange customs in his country, I guess. The future is short too. I have a trip to Burma on Saturday and quite frankly, don't have the energy or time for this right now. He also is headed to Cambodia and Laos next, but I think he's trying to stick around a while first.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I've let my errands go, have minimized my work time (only PETA), and am chomping at the bit to do some writing meditations, yoga, dancing in my room, exploring on my own, and the other me tasks I take so much joy in these days. I argue that it's not too often tall, dark, handsome, and very interested walks into my life, but unfortunately this one can't talk too much (good or bad, really?) and is 13 years younger than me. Yeah.</p>
<p>And then there's the Honda Click to think of, trying to carry my 63 kilos and his 75 kilos. Won't someone think of the bike?</p>
