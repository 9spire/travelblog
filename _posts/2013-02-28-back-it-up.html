<p>I've been in Bangkok approximately four days. The last two days I've spent a good portion of them with Aaron. We cleared up the confusion, discussed the whole situation, and decided we still like each other's company. Quite a lot, actually. I'll be honest, this is difficult to explain, difficult to admit, and difficult to resist. I can justify this 10 ways to Sunday, but it really comes down to finding myself in a similar place with a relationship just like before those last few fateful hours.</p>
<p>This causes me concern for a few reasons. Topping the list is the peaceful, independent, and totally solo journey I've worked so hard to bring up to its current level over the last two months. Is that threatened by trying to spend the next two weeks in Bangkok, running around with Aaron until I fly to Bali? The rational part of my brain says, absolutely, yes.</p>
<p>How then to approach this situation? Run for the beach asap as previously planned? Spend less time at the beach and some time here? Or see how it goes here?</p>
<p>Ah drama, your reappearance into my life is pleasantly tempered by your recent disappearance and I am hoping to keep you yet at bay.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I've wandered into the dense streets of Chinatown, dodging men pushing huge bundles of products through the tiny walkway, past the fried chicken vendor shoving his own cart featuring a wok filled to the brim with boiling oil. I've discovered there are women who set up their old-school foot-powered sewing machines along the sidewalks and will sew on a button for 10 baht. I've also hit up a night market, walked through a cheap fashion mall that boggles the mind in breadth, scope, and total lack of sizes I can wear, got a mani-pedi, and even made it to a meet-and-greet ex-pat networking event at a chi-chi hotel.</p>
<p>Til next time...</p>
