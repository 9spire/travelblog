<p>Okay, I'm doing it. Writing again like I resolved to do. Damn new year. Taking bets on how long I keep it up, a safe bet since no one is reading or knows I'm writing!</p>
<p>First entry was a bourbon and tears-fueled confessional of a lot of TMI, like Â no one should cop to all that, right? But I'm leaving it like an intentional fear trail to follow on sleepless nights.</p>
<p>I feel obligated to write exciting stuff, but I'm almost three weeks into staying at my parents house in a snowed in one horse town in southern Colorado. It's cold and the cabin fever is driving my mom and I to drink more wine than usual and do online shopping.</p>
<p>Its too cold to even enjoy smoking. Boo-hoo, right? Friends are partying down in Portland and I'm damn grateful every time one of them laments my absence.</p>
<p>Ive got that inspiration that comes from a long absence, where I'm planning out crazy ideas that are far too overwhelming for real follow up when I get back. I'll give it a good shot though.</p>
