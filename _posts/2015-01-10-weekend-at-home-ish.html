<p>Met up with a large group for happy hour last night at my friend, Christian's bar, Molokos on Mississippi. Had lovely conversations, some stilted, but for the most part a wonderful time.</p>
<p>Tonight I have my first official houseguest, Melinda has proposed coming out to visit and I am so excited! It has involved putting out the awning, cleaning up the whole place, and dumping my grey water in the pasture. Now that I'm showering in here, all that is left is doing laundry and I'm completely independent. Very exciting!</p>
<p>More chores though so I have to go.</p>
