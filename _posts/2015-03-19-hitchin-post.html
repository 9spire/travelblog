<p>I am a badass mammajamma who is so freaked out about towing this rig! I pulled my tailgate. Only took 3 YouTube videos, some forum searches, and actually reading the user manual.</p>
<p>It's heavy. Really heavy. Can't adjust my grip and arms at full extension, slips off the knee when trying to brace for a re-grip, HEAVY. Lugged it over to the shipping container and managed to gently lower it onto the truck bedliner doing me some actual good again.</p>
<p>Just tested out the hitch. Read <strong>all</strong> of the instructions. Seems pretty clear, but they want the kingpin on the trailer within 1 1/2" of the receiving plate on the hitch. For laughs, I measured the height of the hitch and then the height of my truck bed, added, and I've got to raise the front end of the trailer by at least 12 inches to get under it. This should be very interesting. Very, very, interesting. Not sure my front jacks were made for that kind of action. Makes that bottle jack purchase more useful, but I'm left wondering if I can manage to store a stump for those more-than-14-inches lift jobs.</p>
<p>Why all of the forward motion all of a sudden? I've got a couple of days before I need to move that thing and let some dump trucks dump stuff. Which puts my parking pad on a slightly higher timeline. Which puts my financial situation in the really, really tight category. Taco Bell budget category.</p>
<p>And I'm finally able to function, think, and move after 12 days of being sick and a wickedly difficult bed bug situation. Take it from me, they are resistant to most of the stuff out there supposed to get rid of them.</p>
<p>On my first day of feeling normal, the kind of normal only a come-to-Jesus kind of sick can produce - deceptively normal - I find out there's a bunch of traffic headed soon to where my home is parked. Moving it was the plan anyway. Truly it was. And it's still the plan. Time to get over the fear and do this!</p>
