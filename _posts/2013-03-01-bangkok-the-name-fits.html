<p>I'm on day number five in Bangkok. Has it really been that short of a time? Seems like an awful lot has happened. Randy and Meredith put down Oscar, a 12-year member of their immediate family who had a ton of personality and unique body odors. Their first child as a couple. This news was followed by the news of my Grandmother passing away, my dad's mother, Lois. Also the last surviving member of his family other than his progeny. I'm feeling the distance today, wanting so badly to be with my family, crack jokes, hang out, and just be there.</p>
<p>Aaron and I discussed blogs today and he prefers ones with useful information. I told him not to bother reading mine then. Tonight this feels like a solely selfish blog, less to pass on any information to anyone outside of myself.</p>
<p>Most people (all, even) go into traveling with a set of goals - pet the monkeys, gawk at cool stuff, drink, eat, repeat. Then there are the travelers I've run into in my travels with a more complex set of goals. Getting over an addiction is a common theme. The unhealthy affair, actual drugs, the failed relationship. Looking for happiness (Maybe the NEXT wat), looking for love, looking to obliterate themselves for a few days. Looking to connect with life again.</p>
<p>A Buddhist country isn't such a bad place for most of that. A lot of the time, we end up living out our same lives on a microscale in a new location. That is the fear I hear every conversation I have with that person who's ticket is called up next - those on their way home - did I get enough? Can I sustain this feeling there (for those goal achievers)?</p>
<p>Faced with the sudden realization my birthday is in six days, my big goal was to make two key lime pies. Maybe if I just keep my travel goals on that level, I'll reach unparalleled success.</p>
<p>Adventures today included shopping at Forever 21 in a BKK Monster Mall, eating a great lunch in some back alley restaurant with children's furniture to sit at, and hauling my 30 kilos of crap to yet another place to live for the time being.</p>
