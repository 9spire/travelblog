<p>So, how to blog about when everything goes sideways? Well, I'm not going to spend too much time on this one. No pictures taken, no experiences I really want to share much of, and a rough day today.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, I felt sick yesterday, pretty much the whole day. I had a lovely time with a new girl friend here though, she and I chatted through a pedicure she booked for me, and through her dinner. Very nice to have a friend here who's so sweet, local, and smart.</p>
<p>Woke this morning and I couldn't breathe. I was coughing that deep, lung-bruising kind of cough, gasping for air, and cursing silently the Thai cigarettes I've been smoking. I made it almost to the taxi station when the attack finally subsided and I went home to sleep more. Woke to realize I had missed my first day back at work - 9pm on yesterday evening I was supposed to be at work and I got the schedule all wrong.</p>
<p>Other positive note, I saw my first rain storm today. A real deluge that didn't last long enough to flood a city built on a rice paddy field. In other words, I'm living in land-locked Venice and might get my shot at a gondelier ride if I stay long enough for the real rains.</p>
<p>Got to go the pharmacy for the first time. They really do sell you anything without a prescription. I'm on an inhaler and cough syrup with the mucus relief and a cough suppressant in it. Hoping I can sleep tonight and finding my technique of almost total silence today has minimized coughing. Hoping for healing.</p>
