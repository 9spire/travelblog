<p>Currently listening to a song that was pretty darn emotional for me for the last 18 months. <em><span style="color: #808080;">"Can't keep my cool, I can't hold it inside."</span></em> I loaded up my iPod with emotionally potent songs in order to re-enjoy them, to re-associate them, and most importantly, to remember the circumstances in which they most moved me. As per my first post, I was initially motivated to escape these emotions, to push this away with anger or distraction. And now it's time to go inside,  to relive, re-love, re-pain from a very new and strong place.  More on this later...</p>
