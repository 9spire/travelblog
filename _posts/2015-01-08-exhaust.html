<p>Got home at 5:30 am today. Missed all of work. Did errands like filling the propane, buying groceries, and having an extended conversation with a really nice man about propane fittings and the right kind of step stool for his 92-year-old father to use (artificial knees, artificial hip, pacemaker). I'm totally wiped out from loading and unloading my rental car, having three phone conversations none less than one hour, and just being.</p>
<p>It's good to be home. Melinda says she can hear it in my voice. It's funny how my own little space makes such a difference. It's also 10:40pm and I must sleep very, very soon.</p>
