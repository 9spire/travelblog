<p>The workout of the day:</p>
<p>15 compression fittings tightened</p>
<p>7 crimps applied to junctions under sink</p>
<p>3 terminal valves tightened 3 times</p>
<p>Shopvac entire home 2 times</p>
<p>Shopvac 1 gallon of water in plumbing area</p>
<p>Empty shopvac</p>
<p>Precision toss 2 bales of staw into pig enclosure</p>
<p>Toss two bales of hay from truck bed</p>
<p>clean vinyl floor four times by hand</p>
<p>Complain to father on phone</p>
<p>I'm beat. Plumbing done. Two days worth. Yesterday was equal with a couch removal ( and disassembly), dump run. And three meals in 36 hours. Will attempt sexy outfit at the party tonight, even though it's premature.</p>
