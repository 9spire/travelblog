<p>Those of you who actually follow this thing have probably noticed a significant lack of entries as of late. And, if you're following, you probably already know why. On Friday morning, an unexpected visitor helped themselves to my Macbook Pro 17" computer, brand new iPad, and brand new camera. Also gone is Aaron's point-and-shoot camera, 13" Macbook Pro, phone with friends' numbers from all over the world, and a very nice bag (how else is the thief to carry all of that loot?). This person smoked a cigarette in our dining room, leaving the butt, and walked past our security guard, out the locked gate, and is out there somewhere, hopefully making a few baht from that haul. I'll be really honest: this hurts. Not as much as being harmed, but really a set-back.</p>
<p>I've had some crazy experiences come out of this including purchasing a PC that was half in Thai and had to be returned (money not yet showing back up in my bank account), finding out how much travel insurance covers for electronics ($500?!?), Thai police CSI division practice of having the victim of the crime drop off the evidence at the police department, and meeting/drinking with the family members of the police department - including an officer who tossed back a few whiskey's before work. Doubtful that any of those electronics will be recovered, I'm just out all Christmas presents and a crap-ton of money, my freelance business is mostly on hold, and I'm working really, really hard not to be totally disheartened by this whole experience. It's just money, right? As my friend Mary said once, it's not a real problem if it can be fixed by money. Wise woman who really knows what she's talking about.</p>
<p>I'm currently using Shaughnessy's computer and waiting for Aaron's friend to bring him a new Macbook from the US that I can use for another period of time to show up to work at PETA, until I get a new PC from work and break down and buy a phone with a camera and call it okay. The universe is sending me a clear message - no more Mac products, and travel light and cheap. Point made, universe. Point made. More coming on this blog, I will not be deterred any longer from making entries.</p>
<p>I've also started the overlapping of journal entries from the journal I started one year ago yesterday. I've been reading my handwritten entries and marveling at where I was, where I am, and how totally different/the same it all is. Tough to face down that time in my life, that deep and desperate search for what-Rebecca-wants, and the relationships that are no more in my life, that meant so much then. I thought I knew what love was then. Guess the blessing hidden in that loss is to be open to what love really is, has always been, and end the confusion about what I think it should be. Same with friendship. It's a brave new world and its Mac-free.</p>
