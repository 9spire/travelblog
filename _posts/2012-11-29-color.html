<p>Meredith, if you haven't yet, check out the first 19 minutes of radiolab's podcast on color. Same to you, Andy. Apparently the mantis shrimp has the most complex vision of all creatures yet tested on the planet. But the first 10 minutes discuss Newton's discovery of white being the source of all colors which lead to the subject of perceptual differences. No one really sees color in the same way, and they went so far as to mention that extraterrestrials wouldn't perceive colors the same way as we do.</p>
<p>Which brings me back to a topic that comes up every time I watch an extraterrestrials film: the limited mind applied to imagining E.T. My most recent disappointment in this particular pet peeve would be John Carter.</p>
<p>That being said, the films I brought with me on this trip were Super 8 &amp; Chronicle. A copy of District 9 would round that out nicely.</p>
<p>But back to color and you, Meredith, a creator of color and psychedelic artist, I would love to be the fly on the wall in your imagination when you try to conceive how the mantis shrimp (a tough little bugger who beats the hell out of its prey which includes octupi) would see the world. A rainbow. A face. An energy field. Would its whole existence be one really intense 2CB trip? The world breathing light and color, color patterned overlays, visible sound, visible emotion?</p>
<p>For those of you (which could only mean me, Â as I'm alone in my current evaluation and only projecting this potential argument onto you), who would ask how this is related to a travel blog, well, a travel blog is only mind perceiving external and internal stimulus, or creating that stimulus. So by that definition, this too counts as part of the journey.</p>
