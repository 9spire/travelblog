<p>It's been 8 days since I've last written. My birthday is coming up on the 8th, and well I just like the number/infinity symbol. I'm very happy to realize today that my life is pretty drama free these days. I work, I do projects, I hang out with friends, I go on disastrous dates that amuse me on the rare occasion, and the growth happening is phenomenal.</p>
<p>Granted there was some amount of kicking and screaming and arguing that happened, and the occasional insertion of discontent that lead to this point. I don't want to identify as other than a world traveler yet. I don't have a clue as to how to drive my trailer around, much less where to go with it, when, and how advanced of reservations I should make. I think it's one of those cases where if I'm concerned about reserving space early, it's probably all filled up by now! There's a lot of things to figure out, emotional/mental states that arise, attachments to ideas that aren't true or serving me, but holy moly how great is it to again see it for what it is.</p>
