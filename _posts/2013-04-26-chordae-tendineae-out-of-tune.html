<p>This is my challenge with this blog: to blog when everything is perfect or when my thoughts keep me from the perfection that is always around me. Today falls into the latter category. After such a lovely essay of paradise, I find myself in a mental state that neatly barricades me from the happiness I can be. Hormones can only take so much blame. The rest I have to chalk up to the exploration of attachment and unattachment. I am firmly attached today, as much as a mollosk, as tethered as a barnacle stubbornly clinging to the underside of a boat.</p>
<p>I woke to write pensive poems, glare at the gorgeous sunlight, avoid mirrors, and all of those things I do when there is a chordae tendineae out of tune.</p>
<p>I threw everything at this mood. All of the Byron Katie (moments of peace!), the fantastical aquarium of dreams I swam in, the shoreline of Bali's volcanos in the distance, the delicious hot pizza I ate for dinner. Did it work? In a sense, yes. But there is still that ache of dis-ease working itself out in my thoughts, sometimes forefront and pouting, sullen, other times merely banished for a few precious seconds of coming up for air.</p>
<p>How does this happen? How can I be here, having this experience and have such a bad seed rooted in my chest? How can I have had the learning of the last few months only to recycle the old list of wrongs and ills, rail against non-existant people and crimes I occasionally revist on myself? Is this the chance to finally put one of those aside? Is this the day where I burn off that pain in the hot sun of Indonesia? Change my time to pagi, so-re, and malam and lose that past that rises up to swallow my happiness whole?</p>
<p>No, not today. Basok. Tomorrow. Or tomorrow's tomorrow. The idea of island time neatly encapsulated in one work, Basok. It means tomorrow. But a loose tomorrow. That tomorrow when I finally get it right, buy that ticket home, pay my taxes, find a peace that can stretch out into the basok.</p>
<p>Learning experience? Maybe. Running through the myriad of potentially worst outcomes and having it all subside into a reality that is much kinder is quite the lesson. Still being unwilling to let go of that worst outcome? A lesson in the gentleness of now and the inflexibility of my thoughts to allow for that graceful space in which to surface, mola-mola style to the sun and shake off the parasites that have me iching in paradise.</p>
<p>Guess we'll see, eh?</p>
