<p>Chiang Mai remains unexplored by yours truly. Yeah, I've ventured approximately 1/2 kilometer from the guesthouse in every direction, eaten at every place that looked like it wouldn't punish me the next day (still working on that technique),  and enjoyed the quiet. Fortune-telling papers are fore telling yesterday was a good day to have a baby girl, today is baby boy day. I spend my time working, smoking shisha and working, shoveling green curry and working, sitting by the pool and... well, you get the picture.</p>
<p>Highlights: The spider in my room the size of, well, WAY too big. The British kid that ran up and asked if I wanted to see something cool described it as "big as my fist!". I took the liberty of making a quick sketch of the creature before telling the folks at the front desk that I had an unintended visitor. On checking, the guy told me this was a mosquito-eating spider. Try doing the charades for saying "that spider is welcome anytime". Yeah, I got a weird look from him alright.</p>

An acquaintance from PDX is likely headed here on an overnight train. Let's see if over-worked and under-fun-ned Rebecca can maintain her discipline and work all weekend long....</p>
<p>Not much else to share folks, unless I go into detail about web design and development. Gosh CSS3 sure is exciting and I can't wait to use the animation on some rollovers.... When a client says "fresh" and "colorful", it doesn't necessarily mean either of those things. Yeah. Thought so. Even I'm bored.</p>
<p>Fleeting fantasies from the quickly disciplined mind: motorbike north for visa run - touring Chiang Rai on the way to Laos.... Or, living in Sri Lanka for a month for the visa run....</p>
<p>I have a feeling these blog entries are about to get exciting again. Or at least funny. Until then, here's some pics:</p>
