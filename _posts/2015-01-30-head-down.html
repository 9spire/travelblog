<p>It's been a week of work. Not much else. Not even much thinking beyond the task at hand. Having gotten most of the most urgent work out of the way, my dedication is naturally waning for the weekend. I have only minutes now before my first social engagement over the next two days. But then it is back to the grindstone come Monday.</p>
