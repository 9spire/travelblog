<p>Didn't shed the robe until 1pm. That's the kind of typical day I'm having here in Canon City. Don't misunderstand, the red robe, looking uncannily like a bunch of Elmos died to make it, is my daily uniform for at least some portion of the morning and evening. But only when I'm home. Why am I mentioning this? Because my parents can't stop teasing me about my shapeless, styleless uniform, and because it speaks to the level of getting out there and doing it that is happening.</p>
<p>We did get out. A couple of hours in downtown Florence, Colorado, parusing an amazing variety of antique shops that are divided into little rooms in these old west downtown buildings where the wood floors creak under the watchful gaze of buffalo heads, bear skins, and deer hoof coat racks. There are hundreds of years of history crammed into these spaces, a million salt and pepper shakers, all manner of costume jewelry, and cowboy and indians memorabilia. I was amazed at the sheer amounts, tidy displays, and inter-shop organization where everyone will tell you just what shop you can find that do-hickey from the past to add to your "get-them-all" collection. It's buyable museum of goods. For someone living in less than 300 square feet, it's a little torturous at times when I find something I really like/want, and relieving to know I can't fit any of that crap in my house.</p>
<p>Been cracked out to MK's BBC Radio One Essential Mix from 2014. Gotta share it, gotta work out to it, gotta listen to it until I can't stand it anymore.</p>
<p>You're welcome.</p>
