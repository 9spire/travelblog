<p>The Monday blog entry, a mental pat on the back for not brushing it off or forgetting - although it was pretty close! I ended up with one of those strange days, suddenly warm weather and a stiff breeze but no sun. My mood was similarly temperamental for the majority of the day. My reactions vacillated between anxiety and straight up depression. Oddly enough I worked hardest at work, of course, but secondarily on several hopeful and future-forward lists. How to get my trailer out of the mud. The diet I want to start in mid-January. How to update my upholstery, that oh-so-1992 throwback of dusty rose and country blue that basically makes living in a trailer feel just like that!</p>
<p>As soon as work was over, I threw open the windows and doors, took a leisurely long time in the shower since I won't be able to do that for the foreseeable future, and hit restart on the video game - a.k.a. a nap. I woke to a 55 degree house of fresh air and an improved attitude. My father and I ran some errands, wandered through a farm and ranch store, and when we got home I noted his energy was significantly flagging. This Monday is the day after a long vacation and everyone was feeling it.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I head home to Portland. I'm looking forward to my little home and all of the plans I've made. I'm looking forward to all of the amazing activities and experiences that are around every corner in Portland. I'm most looking forward to investing in a life there in a way I haven't done in over two years. The time feels right to give it another round with the collection of experiences and learning I've been so fortunate to have in my two years away.</p>
