<p>Oh man, oh man, oh man! I'm reading blogs on how to drive a 5th wheel RV, how to back up, turn radius, all kinds of warnings and tips. The hitch gets installed on Tuesday and on March 17th, I pull this rig to a campground and back it into a space. Holy ****, it's going to happen. There isn't a deodorant strong enough for the strongest man, much less me when this goes down. But it's a simple case of, "I have to do it sometime." Like I double dog dared myself to infinity by starting down this path of buying the trailer in the first place, all to lead to hooking up and driving the damn thing somewhere.</p>
<p>My trailer experience is limited to pulling an empty tow bar across three states. That's literally it, so talk about jumping into the deep end of the pool with 31 feet, and a height I haven't measured or calculated yet. Might want to do that sometime... Feels pretty tall when I'm up there scrubbing off moss from the brief stint in the mud on the dark side of the shop. Plenty of heart-stopping excitement for this lady!</p>
<p>In some ways, a lot of ways, this is the ballsiest adventure yet.</p>
<p>There's going to be plenty of stories. I hope. I really hope it's not just one story.</p>
